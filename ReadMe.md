# Visualization Projects

A collection of interactive tools demonstrating fundamental algorithmic concepts, built using **C++**, **SDL**, and **OpenMP**.  
This repository includes visualizations for pathfinding, motion planning, and algorithm performance analysis.  
Originally created as separate projects, all tools are now organized here for easier access and exploration.

## Projects Included

### **1. Path Visualizer**
Interactive visualization of **BFS** and **DFS** on a 2D grid, allowing users to observe traversal order and pathfinding behavior in real time.

### **2. SafeReach**
Parallel and serial comparison of a sampling-based motion planning **backtracking** algorithm, utilizing **OpenMP** to demonstrate speedup through parallelized configuration exploration.

### **3. Games**
Arcade Games: Implemented classic **Snake** and **Block Breaker** games in C++ using SDL, featuring smooth animations, collision handling, and responsive gameplay.
